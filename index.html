                <h1 class="tale_title">a cute fairy tale about kittens</h1>
                <p class="tale_text">Once upon a time there were three little fluffy kittens named Tom, Baby and
                    Mittens.
                    They had very beautiful fluffy fur and most of all they loved to play at the doorstep of the house –
                    to jump and swim in the dust. One day their mother, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, was expecting guests for
                    a
                    cup of tea. And before their arrival, she had to bathe and dress up her minx.First she washed their
                    faces
                    with a sponge.Then she combed their fur coats… And finally fluffed their tails and whiskers. Tom was
                    the most
                    playful of all the kittens, and he didn't really like all this preening and kept pulling away from
                    mom and
                    scratching. Mrs. Tabitha dressed Baby and Mitt in fresh dresses and aprons, and then took out a
                    whole pile
                    of clothes for Tom from the closet. There were a lot of different things there, but Tom didn't like
                    them at
                    all – it was so uncomfortable in them! Mom was surprised, it turns out Tom managed to grow up and
                    get better
                    during this time, that his shirt and pants barely converged on him, and several buttons even broke
                    off and
                    she had to sew them on again.

                    <p>I have three cats living at home, whose names are Athos, Porthos and Aramis. I decided to call
                        them that because I really love this book. The first cat is Athos, he loves to drink valerian
                        and will find it everywhere, wherever it is. Porthos the cat loves to eat and the clink of
                        coins. And the cat Aramis is constantly trying to find a kitty, tells "poems", and if you refuse
                        him something, he will stand in the corner and eat nothing.</p>

                    <p class="intelligence_text">I stopped by my mother's, I look — she's laughing, tears are already
                        flowing. Told: fried
                        cutlets, putting them ready in a plate. Our cat was sitting next to us and pretended that he was
                        not eating cutlets, even looked in the other direction. The mother was going to put the finished
                        ones in a plate, looks — one is missing. The cat is sitting in the same place, looking at her.
                        They played peek-a-boo for a while, then the cat screeched away, leaving the steaming cutlet in
                        the place where he was sitting. Stole it and couldn't think of anything better than to sit on
                        it.
